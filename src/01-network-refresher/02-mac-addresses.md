# Mac addresses

Are identified as `ether` in ifconfig.

(Although it shows as `ether/link` in `ip` command)

A MAC address identifies a device. Anything that uses a network interface is going to have a MAC address.

This is **layer 2**.

MAC addresses are used in switches.

## The actual number

A MAC address is made of 6 pairs of 2 chars.

The first 3 pairs can be used to identify the device (because vendors use the first three pairs apparently)

(This is useful to identify the device I'm running)
