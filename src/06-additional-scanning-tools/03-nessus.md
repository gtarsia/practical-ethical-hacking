# Scanning with nessus

Author starts install and waits a very long time for it to finish.

He creates a basic scan with:

* In discovery "Port scan (all ports)"
* In assesment "Scan for known web vulnerabilities" scan type

... and launches it.

Then creates an advanced scan and gives a quick overview of the different options it has.

Once the basic scan is over, he takes a look at the basic scan results.

Author explains that the newer versions of Nessus group results,
so he clicks gear icon header and then "Disable groups".

Author recommends reporting mostly the more critical issues,
but still report the medium ones if there are few critical ones.

Author mentions that we can export the nessus results,
and that there are other tools that convert that into nicely formatted excel files.

Also recommends not blindly trusting vuln scanners,
after seeing a report you actually have to verify that yourself.
