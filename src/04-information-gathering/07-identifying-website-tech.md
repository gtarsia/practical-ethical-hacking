# Identifying website technologies

Author uses `builtwith.com` to search for a specific website.

The author specifically looks at the frameworks tesla
is using.

Then downloads `wappalyzer` extension
and uses it on tesla site.

Then tries the CLI tool `whatweb`, and runs it with `whatweb https://tesla.com`.

This one does give us the actual version of druap for the tesla site.
