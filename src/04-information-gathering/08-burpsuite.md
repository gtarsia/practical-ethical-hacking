The author downloads and installs burp suite community edition.

Then runs it and setups a proxy on his browser.

The browses `https://burp` and clicks on the CA certificate.

This downloads the certificate,
which then imports from firefox settings.

Then shows pretty much what you can see by running devtools on chrome.
