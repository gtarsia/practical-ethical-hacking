# Password spraying and credentials stuffing

Author explains that credential stuffing is grabbing credentials
from breached compilations and trying them on another server.

Then author installs foxy proxy
so it's easier to enable/disable burpsuite.

Then goes to tesla.com, tries to login with some params:
then intercepts the login request, and right clicks->send to intruder.

Then clears the first parameters, and select username and password,
and clicks `Add $` for each.

He uses a pitchfork attack type, then goes to payloads, and for the first
set he uses the usernames, and for the second uses the passwords.  

This way the first line of the `n` line of the first payload correlates to the `n`
line of the second payload.

Then, runs it, pauses it, and then tries to see for any string saying login
was not successful

He then copies this string and adds it to "grep - match" section in the "Options" tab.
This now shows up as a header with checkboxes on the results.

Then he decides to target a single user with very common passwords.

He recommends to ask what's the policy on ActiveDirectory so we don't lock out
users of which we have to be careful.
