# Manual exploitation

Author recalls the [OpenLuck](https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck) repository
from our notes and `git clone`'s it.

Follows the instructions to compile it,
then runs it with no arguments to read the usage.

From the usage he sees `0x6b - RedHat Linux 7.2 (apache-1.3.20-16)2`.
He uses this since this is what he had obtained from the notes before.

Then runs it with `./Open 0x6b 192.168.143.128 -c 40`, and now he has
shell access outside of metasploit.

Inside, he lists users with `cat /etc/passwd`, and he actually
sees their passwords with `cat /etc/shadow`.

He recommends at this point to enumerate again inside the machine.
