# Non staged vs staged payloads

A non staged payload sends all data at once,
while a staged payload is sent in stages.

One example of a non staged payload is `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`,
while `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` is the staged payload version.

Sometimes, if a non staged payload doesn't work,
we should try to run the staged payload version.
